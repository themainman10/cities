    <li>Thailand is one of the few nations where a monarch is still present.</li>
    <li>The King of Thailand wasn’t even born in Thailand. He was born in America and studied engineering in Switzerland. </li>
    <li>The irony of Thailand’s history is that it never developed any major army, yet it was never colonized by European powers, unlike Asian giants such as India and China. In fact, the very meaning of “Thai” is “free man.”</li>
    <li>There are more than 100 state-owned radio stations in all of Thailand. Private companies are given time slots in these stations’ shows.</li>
    <li>Though the name of the country means “free,” on May 22nd 2014, the Royal Thai Armed Forces organized a coup and overthrew the government.</li>
    <li>It is illegal to step on its currency or even tear it. It may seem like an odd way to respect money, but the real reason is that its currency carries the image of Thailand’s king.</li>
    <li>Thailand has one of the strictest punishments for drug trafficking….a death sentence. Many tourists and foreign nationals are currently serving long terms for minor offenses related to drug use.</li>
    <li>Underwear law of Thailand: Don’t leave your home without wearing your underwear in Thailand unless you want to get arrested.</li>
    <li>Thailand is serious about its respect for the King. Monorails sometimes stop their services when the king is visiting Downtown to maintain the traditional law that the king’s head can’t be lower than anyone else’s. Luckily, there is no ban on flights flying above, up in the sky.</li>
    <li>The king’s anthem is played before any cultural performance, even before Hollywood movies at modern multiplexes.</li>
